This is a project where employees can find project documents and look at schedules!


My company has had a difficult time with scheduling and keeping everyone up to date with documents. With this application, you should be able to create projects, upload documents, and be able to keep a public calendar. This way, each employee will know what other employees are assigned to. 

If i had more time, I will add project document editing in the browser, as well as a more dynamic and user friendly calendar.
