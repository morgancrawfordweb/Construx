This is a project where employees can find project documents and look at schedules!

My company has had a difficult time with scheduling and keeping everyone up to date with documents. With this application, you should be able to create projects, upload documents, and be able to keep a public calendar. This way, each employee will know what other employees are assigned to. 

This website has been deployed, but I'm still making changes while it is live. I am in the process of adding a dynamic calender for scheduling, a way to edit documents in browser to eliminate the need for paperwork and much more! Time has been tight, so these updates will be slow.
