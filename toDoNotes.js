//!These are my notes of things to do while I'm working. This will help my flow and give me things to do while I work and stire up some ideas.

//*1. Add the signatures at the click of a button. Maybe get the first iniitals of the first and last name of the user.

//*2. Double check and make sure that locations DONT cross projects. Maybe check req.params.id and hook those two things together.

//*3. Make sure that templates dont cross to other users.
